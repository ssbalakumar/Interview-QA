## Object Oriented Programming 
 All OOP languages provide mechanisms that help you implement the object-oriented model. The fundamental idea behind OOP is to combine into a single unit both data and the methods that operate on that data; such units are called an object.

Importat concepts of OOPS are: 
1. Classes and Objects
2. Constructor and Destructor
3. Function Overloading
4. Encapsulation
5. Inheritance
6. Interface
7. Polymorphism
   
### Class 
A class is basically a combination of a set of rules on which we will work in a specific program. It contains definitions of new data types like fields or variables, operations that we will perform on data (methods) and access rules for that data.
